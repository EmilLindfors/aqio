## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Project Structure
- `aqio-core/` - Shared models and business logic
- `aqio-api/` - REST API server (Axum)
- `aqio-database/` - Database layer and migrations
- `aqio-frontend/` - Web interface (Dioxus)

### Database Design Principles
- Use descriptive table and column names
- Include proper foreign key constraints
- Add indexes for performance-critical queries
- Follow normalization best practices
- Include audit fields (created_at, updated_at)

### API Design
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use proper HTTP status codes
- Include comprehensive error handling
- Document endpoints with examples
- Validate input data thoroughly

## üß™ Testing

### Test Categories
- **Unit tests**: Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration tests**: Test API endpoints and database operations
- **Migration tests**: Verify database schema changes
- **Performance tests**: Ensure scalability requirements

### Running Tests
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test suite
cargo test --package aqio-api
cargo test --package aqio-database

# Run with coverage
cargo tarpaulin --workspace
```
